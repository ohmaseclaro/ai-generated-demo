# Project Overview

This project is a simple web-based chatbot application designed to interact with users through a web interface. It is built using Node.js and Express for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application serves as a basic demonstration of a chatbot that can respond to user inputs with pre-defined responses.

# Architecture

The architecture of the project is straightforward, consisting of a server-side component and a client-side component:

- **Server-side**: The server is built using Node.js and Express. It handles HTTP requests and serves static files. The server also includes an API endpoint that processes user messages and returns chatbot responses.

- **Client-side**: The client-side is a web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a chat interface where users can type messages and receive responses from the chatbot.

# Key Features

1. **Chat Interface**: The application provides a user-friendly chat interface where users can type messages and receive responses from the chatbot.

2. **Pre-defined Responses**: The chatbot responds with a set of pre-defined messages, selected randomly to simulate a conversation.

3. **Loading Animation**: While the chatbot is processing a response, a loading animation is displayed to enhance user experience.

4. **Responsive Design**: The chat interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across different devices and screen sizes.

5. **Security**: The application uses the Helmet middleware to enhance security by setting various HTTP headers.

# Workflow

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the chat interface by typing a message and clicking the send button or pressing the Enter key.

2. **Message Handling**: The client-side JavaScript captures the user's message and sends it to the server via a POST request to the `/api/chat` endpoint.

3. **Response Generation**: The server receives the message, selects a random response from a predefined list, and sends it back to the client.

4. **Display Response**: The client-side JavaScript receives the server's response and displays it in the chat window. A loading animation is shown while the response is being processed.

5. **Continuous Interaction**: The user can continue to send messages and receive responses, simulating a conversation with the chatbot.
